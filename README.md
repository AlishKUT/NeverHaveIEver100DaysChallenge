# NeverHaveIEver100DaysChallenge
Never Have I Ever App - Android Java

This application was originally developed as part of the 100 Days of Code challenge however it is still an ongoing project. I have created a couple of issues for the Hacktoberfest community.

Developed following MVP architecture with the Mockito library for test purposes.

To see the app in action you can download it from the store at the link below or build it yourself.
